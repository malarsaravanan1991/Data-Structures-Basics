***Implementation of basic data structures in C++ - Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Stack, Tree, Hashing , Heap***

### [LINKED LIST](https://github.com/malarsaravanan1991/Data-Structures-Basics/blob/main/Linkedlist/linked_list.cpp)

* Creation of linked list from array
* Linked List traversal
* Insert Node at nth position in Linked List
* Delete Node at nth position in Linked List
* Reverse Linked list using iterative method
* Reverse Linked List using recursion

### DOUBLY LINKED LIST
* Creation of doubly linked list from array
* Doubly Linked List traversal
* Insert Node at nth position in Doubly Linked List
* Delete Node at nth position in Doubly Linked List
* Reverse Doubly Linked list
